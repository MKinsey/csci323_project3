# csci323_project3
Visit http://orbitable.me/ to see this project in action. This is a server side n-body problem (modeling objects in orbit)
that can render multiple views of the same simulation to clients. Those with admin rights control the simulation while other users
can move their own viewports without affecting the simulation. This project uses: MongoDB, NodeJS, AngularJS, and D3.
